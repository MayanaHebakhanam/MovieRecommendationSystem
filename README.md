What is a Recommendation System???
A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. The information about the user is taken as an input. The information is taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings.

Example:
A recommendation system finds a similarity between the different products. For example, Netflix Recommendation System provides you with the recommendations of the movies that are similar to the ones that have been watched in the past. Furthermore, there is a collaborative content filtering that provides you with the recommendations in respect with the other users who might have a similar viewing history or preferences. There are two types of recommendation systems – Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation. This project used Collaborative Filtering Recommendation.

About the data in the project:
In order to build our recommendation system, we have used the Movie Dataset. You can find the movies.csv and ratings.csv file that we have used in our Recommendation System Project here. This data consists of 105339 ratings applied over 10329 movies.
In this Data Science project, I have made use of these four packages – ‘recommenderlab’, ‘ggplot2’, ‘data.table’ and ‘reshape2’.
